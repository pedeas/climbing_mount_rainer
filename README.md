## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested to understand what I can expect from a climb on Mount Rainer focusing on the following questions:

1. When is peak season for climbing?
2. Is it more likely to succeed if I climb on a popular route?
3. What weather conditions should I aim for if I want to succeed my climb on the most popular route?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebooks available that answers the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There are two .csv files with climbing and weather data from Mount Rainer used to answer the questions.
climbing_statistics - contains climbing statistics for a period of 2 years
Rainier_Weather - contains weather information on daily basis

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@daniel.engstrom89/peak-your-trip-to-mount-rainer-ca3f8f4d8102).
